<h3>Hi there :wave:</h3>

<p>
  My name is Leandro Ferreira, I'm passionate about old games :heart_eyes:, coffee lover :yum: :coffee:, and I love books, I'm currently reading Clean Code :sunglasses:.
</p>
<p>
  I am not currently employed, I am looking to enter the programming market, I have been studying various contents throughout this period, I am currently delving into the concept and improvement of code, such as clean code, SOLID and TDD. 
</p>
<p>
  I have done some projects during this time, now I am focused on a delivery project. My skills are Typescript, NodeJs, SQL, NoSQL, Socket.io, ReactJs, Expo and ReactNative. This is me, an immense pleasure. :v:
</p>
